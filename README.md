Bouncing Balls Loader

What this is : 
A small, friendly loading animation with four colorful balls that bounce in a nice rhythm over a soft shadow. It looks playful without being distracting, and it drops into any page in a couple of minutes.

Why you might like it:
It gives people something pleasant to look at while things load.
You can tweak the speed and size with simple sliders.
There’s a pause button if you want it still for screenshots or demos.
Quick theme switcher (Warm, Cool, Dark, Candy) so it can match your vibe.
It plays nicely with reduced‑motion settings.

How to use it:

Add the HTML section where you want the loader.
Include the CSS for the colors and motion.
Hook up the JS to make the controls work.
Use it full screen as a splash or tuck it into a small corner as a widget.

What makes it nice
The timing feels smooth and natural—no jittery jumps.
The soft background shapes make it feel modern without stealing attention.
It scales well on phones, tablets, and desktops.
